                    In 1775, after the first engagement of American troops with the British at Lexington and Concord,
                    Hamilton<br> and some of the other King's College students joined a New York volunteer militia<br>
                    company
                    called the
                    Corsicanslater, renamed<br> or reformed as the Hearts of Oak.<br> Hamilton studied military history
                    and tactics on his own and was soon recommended for promotion<br> Hamilton eventually received an
                    invitation he felt he could not refuse: to serve as Washington's aide in the war

                <h2 id="head4">Field Command</h2>
                <p id="field">While on Washington's staff, Hamilton long sought command<br> and a return to active
                    combat.
                    As the war drew nearer to an end<br>, he knew that opportunities for military glory were
                    diminishing.<br> On
                    February 15, 1781, Hamilton was reprimanded<br> by Washington after a minor misunderstanding. </p>
